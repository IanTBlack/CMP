# Collaborative Monitoring Platform
The CMP is funded by [Oregon Sea Grant](https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/) and resulted from the combined effort of the Oregon commercial fishing and scientific communities to compose a modular platform that would produce data usable by both sectors.

The system is currently comprised of three temperature-salinity sensors placed at three depths (3ft, 7ft, and 11ft) and located at the commercial docks in Newport, OR.

Data is collected in real-time at 30 minute intervals and is made available on Seacast, an application found in the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems Visualization System ([NANOOS NVS](http://nvs.nanoos.org)). To access the latest telemetered data, go to http://nvs.nanoos.org/Seacast and click on the [station icon located in Yaquina Bay](http://nvs.nanoos.org/Seacast?action=oiw:fixed_platform:OSU_Yaquina).

Data is also recorded by each sensor at 15 minute intervals and will be recovered and archived as maintenance is performed on the platform. Archived data will be made available in this repository.
Navigate to Data > Yaquina_Dock5 to access archived data.
