# Collaborative Monitoring Platform
The CMP resulted from the combined effort of the Oregon commercial fishing and scientific communities to compose a modular platform that would produce data usable by both sectors.

The system is comprised of three temperature-salinity sensors placed at three depths (3ft, 7ft, and 11ft) and located at the commercial docks in Newport, OR.

Data is collected in real-time at 30 minute intervals and is made available on Seacast, an application made available through the NANOOS NVS. To access the latest data, go to nvs.nanoos.org/Seacast and click on the station icon located in Yaquina Bay.

Data is also recorded by each sensor at 15 minute intervals and will be recovered and archived on a two month basis. Archived data will be made available in this repository.
